NGinnBPM.MessageBus.Mongo
an attempt to implement NGInn.MessageBus functionality on top of MongoDB

Idea I
Use capped collections for queue storage
and tailable cursor for retrieving messages from the queue
Tailable cursors are only available for capped collections

Pros: 
- automatic cleanup
- performance and very low latency
- simple
Cons:
- no easy way of implementing scheduled messages/retrying/failures


Idea II
Use an ordinary (uncapped collection)
Implement atomic message retrieval (findAndModify)
